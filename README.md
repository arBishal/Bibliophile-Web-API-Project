# About this Project

This is the implementation of an academic project to demonstrate the workings of APIs.
In this project, we have developed an e-commerce platform where users can browse books. Buy one by making payments through the bank if they like to do so. The backend APIs manages the interactions between users, bank and the supplier.

## Technologies We've Used
Mainly this is a Next.js web-app. We've used javascript, typescript. For frontend styling, we've used CSS and AntDesign packages.

## Visual
Some screenshots will be soon added for your convenience!

# How to Run the App

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
